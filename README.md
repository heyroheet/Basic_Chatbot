# Basic_Chatbot by: Rohit Raman

 The code is a basic implementation of a chatbot in Java. It takes user input through the 'Scanner' class and responds based on a set of conversational logic implemented using 'if-else' statements. The chatbot greets the user with a message and then enters a loop to continuously listen and respond to the user's input.

The chatbot is programmed to respond to three specific phrases: "hi", "how are you", and "bye". If the user inputs any of these phrases, the chatbot will respond with a predefined message. If the user inputs anything else, the chatbot will respond with a message saying that it doesn't understand what the user is saying and asks the user to rephrase.

The loop continues until the user inputs "bye", at which point the chatbot will say goodbye and terminate the loop. The 'Scanner' object is then closed to free up resources.
